Launching the Player

Because drop of support for native plugins in Webbrowsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox
you would need to load url's in the BSContact Player->File Open Command.

Microsoft Internet Explorer supported the hosting of the Active X compononent BSContactVmrl.ocx,
so there are many examples using the WebBrowser HTML integration.
A workaround solution to open an url in BSContact is by simply clicking in a WebBrower, is to create a BSURL file.
Its the same fromat as the Windows URL InternetShortCut file, but bsurl is associated with BSContact.exe


Eaxmple bsurl file, save as  textfile with .bsurl extension:
[InternetShortcut]
URL=https://www.bitmanagement.de/developer/contact/examples/texcoordGen/venus_gradient.wrl

Examples:
https://github.com/HolgerGrahn/Vrml/tree/main/Examples/bsurl

click on a file, use the GitHub download button, double click in  the download file to open BSContact.exe or drag the link into an open BSContact.
